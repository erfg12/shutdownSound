# shutdownSound
For Windows 8 & 10. Let's the system make a shutdown sound.

When launching this program it will be in your system tray. Click on the icon to restore it.

Browse to a .WAV sound file you want played when this program exits (system shuts down).

Program will save your file path. Place this program in your startup folder.

Default startup path: "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"

It calculates the .wav file's audio length, plays the audio file, then pauses for audio length so it can fully play that file.
